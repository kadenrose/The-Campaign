                Mark Hampton is a longtime resident of Maricopa County, committed to making local government more responsive and more transparent. Mark prides himself as being an entrepreneur, husband, and father of 5 children. According to Mark, real change starts at the local level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mark has served on several community boards in the past where he focused on neighborhood development and safety. His contribution to the county's planning has brought much needed infrastructure improvements to the valley. Mark has a simple approach: listen more, talk less, and always put others first.
                <br><br>
                Mark was born and raised in Mesa, Arizona into a family of six. His childhood was spent volunteering at his church and joining student council at his schools. He graduated Scottsdale High in 1980, graduated from the University of Arizona in 1984 with a bachelor's in engineering. He married his wife, Sarah in 1982. Started his own business where he and his employees worked contracts with local governments enforcing safety and fire codes. 
                <br><br>
                Mark originally felt called to office in 2022 where he faced trouble expanding his business and encountered firsthand how outdated the local policies were. Motivated to make a difference, Mark left his practice and is running for office 2026.
